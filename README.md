# Course Code

## 1.  DBSCAN

DBSCAN is a density-based clustering algorithm, which realizes the clustering and visualization of two-dimensional data.



## 2.  Optic

optic is also a density-based clustering algorithm and an improved version of DBSCAN.



## 3.  SVM

SVM algorithm is used to classify the fetch_lfw_prople data sets in sklearn.



## 4.  Kmeans and PAM

Kmeans algorithm and PAM algorithm are used to cluster images and waveform data sets. PAM algorithm, also known as Kmediod algorithm, is an improvement of kmeans.



## 5.  CLARA

Classification of MNIST handwritten data sets using Clara algorithm. Clara algorithm is a big data clustering algorithm based on PAM.



# 6.  FashionMnist

Classification of fashion data sets by ResNet.



# 7.  Eight-Puzzle

Using depth first, breadth first and A star algorithm to solve the eight digit problem.



## 8.  Genetic-algorithms

Using genetic algorithm to solve the optimization problem of binary function.



## 9.  Kmeans FCM

Compare the effect of kmeans algorithm and FCM algorithm in image segmentation and data clustering using matlab.



## 10.  Optimization

Using interpolation method and golden section method to solve one variable multiple optimization problems.



## 11.  Sentiment analysis

Using the web crawler to climb up the comments in weibo and BiliBili, emotional analysis and word cloud display.
